# Inheritance with the Gaussian Class

To give another example of inheritance, take a look at the code in this Jupyter notebook. The Gaussian distribution code is refactored into a generic Distribution class and a Gaussian distribution class. Read through the code in this Jupyter notebook to see how the code works.

The Distribution class takes care of the initialization and the read_data_file method. Then the rest of the Gaussian code is in the Gaussian class. You'll later use this Distribution class in an exercise at the end of the lesson.

Run the code in each cell of this Jupyter notebook. This is a code demonstration, so you do not need to write any code.
